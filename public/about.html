<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!<br/>I am Kashish Raheja, a passionate and curious learner currently diving into the world of web development. I'm a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Amity University Rajasthan, and I have recently started exploring the exciting technologies that power the web — from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond.</p>
<p>I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly websites and constantly seek opportunities to turn ideas into interactive digital experiences. Right now, I am focused on strengthening my front-end skills while gradually stepping into back-end development.</p>
<p>This portfolio reflects my learning journey — the projects I have built, the challenges I have overcome, and the progress I continue to make every day. I believe in learning by doing, and I am excited to grow into a confident full-stack developer in the near future.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by — let us build something awesome!</p>
